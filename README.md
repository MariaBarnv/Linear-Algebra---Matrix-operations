# Linear-Algebra---Matrix-operations
This task involves using NumPy for matrix multiplication, generating cyclic patterns, and creating matrices framed with ones. It includes summing values across rows and columns, logical AND/OR operations, finding non-zero elements, and working with random values in an 8x8 array. It also covers creating custom n√ón matrices based on specific rules.
